# Hubs Architecture Kit

This repository contains the assets that power the Architecture Kit in [Spoke](https://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke). In this repo, you will find the Blender files, as well as textures and the deployment script that is used to publish to Spoke. 

The Hubs Architecture Kit is one example of configurable pieces that can be used to create new meshes in Spoke. In the future, we plan to make it easy for 3D artists to create their own kits and publish them to Spoke using a similar format as this kit.
